# Student Performance Analysis: Study Time vs Final Grade

Predict student grades from study time using correlation and linear regression.

---

## Description
This project analyzes the relationship between **study time** and **final grades (G3)** using the UCI Student Performance Dataset (`student-por.csv`). It explores whether the amount of time a student spends studying impacts their final score.

The analysis includes:
- **Pearson correlation** between study time and grades
- **Simple linear regression** to model and predict final grades
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate prediction accuracy
- Example predictions for given study times
